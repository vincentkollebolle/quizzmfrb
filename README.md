Quizz MFRB.

Description
===

This project is a Quizz like the one you can find in magazine.  
You'll be asked to answer few questions about how do you feel with employ/work/activity.  
Each time you have 4 possible answers and in the end, we tell you what is your "profile".   
It is an humouristic quizz to help people to discover the idea of a  [Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) and discover our non profit organisation French Movment for a Basic income: [MFRB](https://www.revenudebase.info/)   

So for each question you have 4 categories of answers (hamster, philo, robot, surf).   
Choosing one increase your number of points for this category.  
After the last question the quizz pick the category where you have the maximum amount of points and give you your profile.
And you'll be abble to share it on social network or invite someone to do the quizz too. 
It's a communication tool for non-profit cause.
